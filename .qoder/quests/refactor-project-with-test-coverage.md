# River Project Refactoring and Test Coverage Enhancement

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the refactoring plan for the River project to improve code quality, maintainability, and test coverage. The goal is to achieve a minimum of 80% test coverage across all components while restructuring the codebase for better separation of concerns and improved architecture.

The River project is a Go-based application designed to automate salary payments on the blockchain, targeting Ethereum or EVM-compatible networks. It interacts with ERC-20 tokens (e.g., USDC) and manages employer and employee data via a local SQLite database.

## 2. Current Architecture Analysis

### 2.1 Repository Type
The River project is a **Backend Application** built with Go that automates salary payments on the blockchain. It uses:
- Go as the primary language
- SQLite for local data persistence
- Ethereum blockchain for token transfers
- Cobra for CLI interface
- Viper for configuration management

### 2.2 System Architecture
The current architecture follows a CLI-driven modular Go application with layered architecture:
- **Command Layer** (`cmd/`, `main.go`): CLI entrypoints using Cobra.
- **Business Logic Layer** (`internal/salary`, `internal/payment`): Handles salary scheduling and blockchain payments.
- **Data Access Layer** (`db/`, `internal/repository`): Manages database interactions.
- **Entity Layer** (`internal/entity`): Domain models.
- **Smart Contract Integration** (`internal/payment/abi`): ERC-20 ABI for token transfers.

### 2.3 Identified Issues
1. **Low Test Coverage**: Currently, there are no unit tests or integration tests in the project
2. **Tight Coupling**: Components are tightly coupled with business logic mixed with infrastructure concerns
3. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling throughout the codebase
4. **Configuration Management**: Configuration loading is scattered across multiple files
5. **Database Operations**: Database operations lack proper transaction management in some areas
6. **Blockchain Interaction**: Direct dependency on Ethereum client without abstraction
7. **Code Organization**: Business logic is mixed with infrastructure concerns in several files
8. **Missing Input Validation**: No validation for critical inputs like Ethereum addresses
9. **Hardcoded Values**: Token contract addresses and other values are hardcoded
10. **Inconsistent Logging**: Logging is not consistently implemented across components

### 3.3 Design Patterns Implementation
1. **Dependency Injection**: Using constructor injection to improve testability
2. **Repository Pattern**: Abstracting data access for better testability
3. **Service Layer**: Separating business logic from infrastructure concerns
4. **Interface Abstraction**: Creating interfaces for external dependencies
5. **Factory Pattern**: For creating complex objects like blockchain clients
6. **Singleton Pattern**: For configuration and database connection management

## 4. Refactoring Plan

### 4.1 Configuration Management
**Issue**: Configuration loading is scattered in main.go and cmd/root.go
**Solution**: Create a dedicated config package with proper validation

```go
// internal/config/config.go
type Config struct {
    Node       string   `mapstructure:"NODE"`
    PrivateKeys []string `mapstructure:"PRIVATE_KEYS"`
    DatabasePath string `mapstructure:"DATABASE_PATH"`
}

func Load() (*Config, error) {
    // Implementation
}
```

Key improvements:
- Centralized configuration loading
- Environment variable binding
- Configuration validation
- Proper error handling

### 4.2 Database Layer Enhancement
**Issue**: Direct SQL operations without proper abstraction
**Solution**: 
1. Improve transaction handling
2. Add proper error wrapping
3. Implement repository interfaces for better testability
4. Add connection pooling for better performance
5. Implement proper context handling for timeouts
6. Add query logging for debugging

Key improvements:
- Database interface abstraction
- Context-aware operations
- Proper transaction management
- Connection pooling

### 4.3 Service Layer Separation
**Issue**: Business logic mixed with CLI and infrastructure concerns
**Solution**: 
1. Move salary payment logic to dedicated service packages
2. Create proper interfaces for dependencies
3. Implement proper error handling and logging
4. Add input validation for all service methods
5. Implement proper context propagation
6. Add comprehensive logging

Key improvements:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Dependency injection
- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation

### 4.4 Blockchain Client Abstraction
**Issue**: Direct dependency on go-ethereum client
**Solution**: 
1. Create an interface for blockchain operations
2. Implement the interface with the current Ethereum client
3. Add mock implementation for testing
4. Add retry mechanisms for network operations
5. Implement proper error handling and logging
6. Add transaction monitoring

Key improvements:
- Interface abstraction
- Retry mechanisms
- Transaction monitoring
- Proper error categorization

### 4.5 CLI Handler Layer
**Issue**: Business logic embedded in CLI command handlers
**Solution**:
1. Extract CLI handling to dedicated handler packages
2. Implement proper command validation
3. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
4. Separate success and error output streams
5. Add progress reporting

Key improvements:
- Separation of CLI handling from business logic
- Better user experience
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Progress feedback

## 5. Test Coverage Strategy

### 5.0 Test Organization
The testing strategy follows a pyramidal approach with unit tests forming the base, integration tests in the middle, and end-to-end tests at the top.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Unit Tests] --> B[Integration Tests]
    B --> C[End-to-End Tests]
    
    style A fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#388E3C
    style B fill:#2196F3,stroke:#0D47A1
    style C fill:#FF9800,stroke:#E65100
    
    A1[Service Layer] --> A
    A2[Repository Layer] --> A
    A3[Client Layer] --> A
    
    B1[Database Integration] --> B
    B2[Blockchain Integration] --> B
    
    C1[CLI Commands] --> C
```

Key principles:
- Unit tests should cover at least 90% of business logic
- Integration tests should validate component interactions
- End-to-end tests should cover critical user workflows

### 5.1 Testing Frameworks
- **Unit Testing**: `testing` package with `testify` for assertions
- **Mocking**: `gomock` for interface mocking
- **Test Coverage**: Built-in Go coverage tools
- **Integration Testing**: Docker-based Ethereum testnet for blockchain integration tests
- **Fuzz Testing**: For critical input validation functions
- **Benchmark Testing**: For performance-critical functions
